Title- ride along
About- motorcycle club trend in India
Introduction
For decades, the motorcycle has been a means of escape from the everyday hassle, the ability to take off on two wheels has allowed the possibility of freedom in an ever-shrinking world. Those who have realized the freedom that the motorcycles allow have all played a crucial role in the evolution of motorcycle culture that exists today.
The riding industry in India has been growing leaps and bounds over the last decade. What used to earlier be a niche group of riders has now grown to a thriving and kicking industry.
Simultaneously the growth path has been marked with high end motorcycle brands coming into the country. The growth of motorcycle festivals in the country over the last few years is testimony to the growing popularity of riders and the riding community in India.
An increasing number of people are recognizing not only the utility of motorcycles but bringing out the passion in them and bonding with like-minded people.
Many people like to travel long distances.
Being a rider to travel to a far destination with group of friends who are riders make the trips very adventurous and fun.
Because being a part of biking group has many benefits. Biking groups take brotherhood to another level. When you ride in a group you know you are safe, protected and have people to watch your back, bike breakdowns, accidents and a host of other worries are almost nullified when you ride in a group as support is always at hand.
This is what brings us to our problem statement.

Problem statement
If not riding in a group or if a person is riding/travelling solo for a long-distance pile up in huge stack of worries such as bike breakdowns, flat tires, sense of consciousness, insecurity or fear of unknown public behavior within new or unknown places, some may experience boredom which may spoil the whole point of travel enjoyment and other host of worries.
In most of the long-distance travelling scenarios not everyone in the biking group gets the time to plan up on a ride and ride along, this may lead to solo travelling.

Hypothesis
To eliminate the worries and problems as discussed above we can create an application in which a solo rider can input his destination and find out other riders who are travelling to the same destination and they have updated their destination as an input.
Hence the riders can communicate with each other through the application and can form a group to travel to their destination.
This eliminates the problems of riding solo and helps to establish new relationships between complete strangers.
In long distance touring there are many more problems that the rider faces. Such as finding good food, accommodation, good parking for their beloved bikes.
Here in our application, we can put a community section where other bikers who have done that route may share his experience and resources which every user can access and by using this information, he/she can plan accordingly.
On basis of much more information shared by many users we as a developer can tie up with most appreciated hotels i.e., accommodation services, restaurants, mechanic shops, showroom service centers etc. along the specified route.
We can also add a section in the app where it shows all the fuel stations on the routes using API’s.
One section in the app can be of “must visit locations” which arrive along the route, and we can also provide navigation features for the same using API.
There are many more things that can be added to help convert the user requirements based on feedbacks that we can take from the users.
By the means of the above-mentioned hypothesis, we can achieve the solution to the problem statement of a solo traveler whose passion is to explore his dream destinations.
